I have undertaken a project from the MATLAB-Simulink Challenge Project Competition, formally titled "Reinforcement Learning Based Fault Tolerant Control of a Quadrotor." However, I have opted to modify the project to focus solely on the Fault Tolerant Control of a Quadrotor, as reinforcement learning is a significant challenge for me due to my limited experience. The official project description calls for the training of a Reinforcement Learning agent to develop a fault-tolerant controller for a quadcopter. The framework uses system dynamics and a Kalman filter-based estimator to dynamically estimate fault-related parameters online. These parameters are subsequently employed to identify the occurrence of a fault within the system. Once a fault event is identified, the RL agent is tasked with tuning the position and attitude controller gains of the quadcopter to mitigate the effects of the fault. My motivation for this project is to get some experience with Simulink and learn about basic control theory. My intent is to follow all project steps, except I have chosen to abstain from those involving reinforcement learning.
